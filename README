### Reset mainWP Child plugin settings to default as if you just installed it.
_Keep in mind this resets the entire plugin and you will have to reconnect.
Feel free to __use at your own risk__ instead of the SQL statement talked about Below._

# [WARNING] DO NOT USE ON MAINWP DASHBOARD INSTALLATION!
## THIS IS A FRESH START!
_Using this plugin will _ERASE ALL mainWP data from the child site._ This also includes all Code Snipit that have been ran on the child
site using the [mainWP Code Snitpit plugin](https://mainwp.com/extension/code-snippets/ ) This snipits are stored withing the Child Plugin DB and will 
need to be readded once the site has been reconnected. Along with any other Branding changes.

## Usage
1. Download the Plugin .Zip
2. Install like any other Plugin
3. Active the plugin. It will automatically run and deactivate itself.
4. Delete the plugin after use by clicking the delete button on the plugin ( there is no Database entries )

##  About
#### Inspired by a conversation I had with Conor Treacy here: [mainWP User FB thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MainWPUsers/permalink/2461997537230239/)

I have used the SQL solution written at the bottom of this [mainWP User FB thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MainWPUsers/permalink/1139990406097632/)
here often when the mainWP Dashboard looses connection in order to regain control of the mainWP Child Plugin. However, I find the steps
involved in the process a bit teadiouse just to re-install a plugin. So I took the SQL solution and created a plugin out of it.

This plugin runs the same exact SQL query it's just in plugin form & cuts down the steps it takes to in order to reset the settings to default and gain access to your child plugin once again.
There is no need to log into CPanel, find out the DB name & log in to phpmyadmin etc... 
 

### Now it's just

1. Download
2. Install
3. Activate
4. Delete
